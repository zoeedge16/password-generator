# password-generator

## Description

A password generator was created by using html, css, and javascript. The usage of if statments and for loops was necessary in order to create a text editor that takes in uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. The webpage takes you to a site that allows for you to choose what kind of chracters you would like to use in your password. The password may only be between 8-128 characters. The user is first prompted to give a desired length of password before moving on to desired characters.
